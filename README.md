# EventFusion Project SOEN 343 (Winter 2025)

## Objective

The mission of this project is to develop **EventFusion**, an intelligent and modular Smart Education Event System (SEES) designed to enhance event promotion, networking, and stakeholder engagement. The platform empowers **educators**, **students**, **sponsors**, and **organizers** through advanced features such as AI-powered chat, live event coordination, smart matchmaking, and campaign tracking — all within an intuitive, scalable interface.

The project follows modern microservice architecture and frontend best practices, enabling efficient integration of modular services, real-time interactions, and data-driven decisions for both in-person and hybrid academic events.

## Project

**EventFusion** is a web application that streamlines the management, promotion, and participation in academic events. The system is built with a microservices-based backend and a modern React-based frontend using **shadcn/ui** and **Next.js**.

### Key Features:

- 📢 Social media & email campaign manager  
- 🧾 Sponsor ROI tracking  
- 🔄 Smart matchmaking between attendees and sessions  
- 🗓️ Admin dashboards and user registration  
- 📨 Attendee list and detail view

The system uses **MongoDB** for persistence, **Node.js (TypeScript)** for backend services, and **Stripe** for payment services.
